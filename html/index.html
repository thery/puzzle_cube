    <h1>How does it work</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To enter a starting position, click on the square you want to turn blue, 
        after entering the 6 squares, chose the initial position of the cube;
      </li>
      <li>
        To move the cube, just click on the square you are aiming at;
      </li>
      <li>
        The black area gives some information: the number of moves that have
        been played so far, one optimal next move and the minimal number of
        moves that are necessary to complete the challenge.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Clicking on the number of moves performs an undo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on the black area modifies the amount of information that is 
        provided.
      </li>
    </ul>
